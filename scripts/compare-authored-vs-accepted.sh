# Assert the loader built what the author wrote.
#
# ADR-0014 requires a profile's round trip to compare the loaded model against
# the post-edit model. The rest of the gate proves the game *accepted* the
# artifact and *replayed* it deterministically -- both weaker claims: a compiler
# that silently dropped a taxonomy term or retimed a command would still produce
# a package the game accepts and replays identically to itself.
#
# Deliberately does not compare `scenario`. The compiler copies the game-owned
# fixture into the package verbatim, so diffing it back would prove only that
# serde round-trips JSON.
